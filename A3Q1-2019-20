This questions allows you to show your Text, CSV, or XML Input/Output knowledge.  Create a flowchart, an IPO chart, and a trace table.  Then
write a program that uses any valid txt/csv/xml file you have pulled.  Good sources are from a reliable source (Stats Can, a Univ weather site etc.)  Make sure you document where your CSV file is from.
a.	Your csv file must have a minimum of 4 columns and
b.	A minimum of 50 rows (some exceptions do apply for more columns and less rows depending upon your interests - EMail any alternate requests
       to your teacher for approval.
c. You must write out summary data as applicable.  Examples of the functions you may use are; 
                                         i.	Average (no function, but this is just a “Sum” (a built in function) divided by your row data.
                                        ii.	Min (it’s a function)  see Example at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/list_min.htm

                                       iii.	Max (it’s a function)  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/list_max.htm

                                       iv.	Sub totals for a particular subcategory (ie: province vs Canada, time of year Fall vs. Spring.
                                          This is obviously a weather example, but it really does depend upon your data and topic.)
d.  Your output should be to both screen and txt/csv/xml file.  Make the output to screen look nice, formatted properly (marks lost for jumbles).
